This folder should contain all styles used in entire project.

All constants should be assembled inside shared.scss

index.scss should contain all global styles


Regarding component styles I am still not sure if they should be kept under this folder.
It probably makes sense to keep them where components are declared,
due to the fact that styles are being imported there. See App.tsx for example.
