    $curl localhost:8080        //To test endpoints via terminal

    Click on spring-starter/Lifecycle/test  in Maven tab to run tests


DOCKER WORKFLOW:

To get a .jar file
./mvnw install      //I just clicked spring-starter/Lifecycle/install in Maven tab

To build docker image cd into /backend folder and           //TODO change myorg/myapp to something meaningful
$ docker build -t myorg/myapp .

After build is done check that you have the image
$ docker images

To run it
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 myorg/myapp

To get inside the image
$ docker run -ti --entrypoint /bin/sh myorg/myapp

For a better docker file.
$ mkdir target/dependency
$ (cd target/dependency; jar -xf ../*.jar)
$ docker build -t myorg/myapp .
